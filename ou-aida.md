# USE CASE AIDA BY The Open University

## Context
The Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph describes 21M publications and 8M patents according to the research topics drawn from the Computer Science Ontology (http://cso.kmi.open.ac.uk/). 5.1M publications and 5.6M patents are further characterized according to the type of the author's affiliations (academy, industry, or collaborative) and 66 industrial sectors (e.g., automotive, financial, energy, electronics) organized according to the INDUSO ontology (https://aida.kmi.open.ac.uk/downloads/induso.ttl). AIDA was generated by an automatic pipeline that integrates data from Microsoft Academic Graph, Dimensions, DBpedia, the Computer Science Ontology, and the Global Research Identifier Database. It is publicly available under CC BY 4.0 and can be downloaded as a dump or queried via a triplestore. The aim of AIDA is analysing the knowledge flow between academia and industry, understanding which directions have the biggest potential, and discovering the best strategies to harmonise their efforts.

## Challenges
1. Generating a coherent KG from multiple sources: Microsoft Academic Graph, Dimensions, DBpedia, and the Global Research Identifier Database.
2. Improving the scalability of the generation process.
3. Improving data completeness (e.g., detecting the industrial sectors of companies that are not in DBpedia).
